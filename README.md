# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST Dataset


This repository contains a Python project for Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The goal of this project is to build and train a machine learning model to accurately classify these handwritten digits.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It has various real-world applications, including automatic check processing, postal mail sorting, and more. In this project, we leverage the MNIST dataset to develop a model capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits.
